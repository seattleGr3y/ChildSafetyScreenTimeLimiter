I CREATED THIS SCRIPT BECAUSE MY SON HAS A HARD TIME SELF-REGULATING HIS GAMING\YOUTUBE TIME
I SET VARIABLES FOR THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR THE PC TO BE UP AND USABLE
AND VARIABLES FOR LENGHT OF TIME FOR THE PC TO AUTOMATICALLY GO TO SLEEP
THE MESSAGEBOX THAT POPS UP WILL COVER THE ENTIRE SCREEN AND HAS NO BUTTONS OR RED X IN THE CORNER TO CLOSE IT OUT
IT TELLS THE USER THERE IS N AMOUNT OF TIME BEFORE THE PC WILL GO TO SLEEP AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS IT WILL BE ASLEEP
THERE ARE SCHEDULED TASKS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS
ONE WILL PUT THE PC TO SLEEP AND ANOTHER WILL WAKE IT BY OPENING A NOTEPAD WITH A MESSAGE TO THE USER INFORMING THEM TO JUST CLOSE THE 
NOTE AND HOW MANY HOURS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO USE THE PC 
AT THAT POINT A NEW SCHEDULED TASK HAS ALREADY BEEN CREATED FOR THE NEXT TIME THE PC SHOULD GO TO SLEEP 

THERE IS ALSO A CHECK THAT THE TIME WILL NOT BE BEYOND 11:30PM WHEN IT DOES GET THAT LATE THE WAKEUP TIME IS SET TO 8 HOURS RATHER THAN 2

I AM USING CODE THAT I FOUND ELSEWHERE FOR CREATING THE MESSAGEBOX : https://gist.github.com/SMSAgentSoftware/0c0eee98a673b6ac34f5215ea6841beb New-WPFMessageBox
THIS FUNCTION EXISTS ONLY TO CREATE AND DISPLAY THE MESSAGEBOX
THIS CAN AND SHOULD BE SIMPLIFIED FOR THIS USAGE I WILL DO THAT LATER

FIRST STEP WILL COPY THE FILES NEEDED TO EXECUTE INTO AN APPDATA DIRECTORY TO BE THEN EXECUTED VIA SCHEDULED TASKS FOR REBOOTS FROM THE REGISTRY RUN KEY
GET CURRENT TIME TO CALCULATE WHEN TO WAKE PC FROM SUSPEND STATE
CREATE TASK THAT WILL OPEN NOTEPAD FILE BUT THIS IS MOSTLY DONE TO FORCE THE PC TO WAKE FROM SUSPEND STATE
CREATE SCHEDULED TASK TO OPEN TEXT FILE AS A MESSAGE USING THAT BASICALLY AS THE EXCUSE TO USE THE SCHEDULED TASK TO WAKE THE PC FROM SUSPEND STATE
enable auto-hide the taskbar
message box pop-up on timer to close
disable auto-hide the taskbar
put PC to sleep (suspend state)
scheduled task that was created and set to execute at specified time will then execute and as part of its own process will wake the PC
